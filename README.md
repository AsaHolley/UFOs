## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage and build a dynamic table to research UFO sightings from a large array of sightings. The new website is now filterable for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, the website is able to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
To use this webpage simply type into the filter bars what you are looking for using hte sample syntax provided and press the filter button. An example is listed below showing all of sighting results from searching for "ca" and the dae "1/1/2010". The website is built so that a visitor can use all 5 of the search criteria or simply just use one at a time.

## Summary 
  * One drawback to this website is that filters are off to the side of the webpage and not over the actual column headings of the table so that it is less intuitive than it could be for a user. An additional drawback is user cannot save their searches or download their searches for their own research purposes.
  
  * A few  recommendations for further development would be; 1) add a download button for those who come to the website and perform a search, 2) add a section for people to add sighting to the table, and 3) add a section for people to add their emails and contact information to share with other UFO enthusiast.
